Subject: tech lead skill share

_How do you learn to be a good leader and support system for other people and teams? It's still the hardest problem in computer science.. apparently._

Corona times are still upon us, and I've finally decided to steal [Charity Major's idea](https://github.com/charity/tech-leads-skill-share)
of doing a leadership skill share. I've stolen half of this mail from the original script, so credits go there.

I think that the idea of learning through good stories is a great one, and that it is important to build up your "leadership toolbox". So we're trying to build this up and learn from each other. I'll tweak the original plan a bit to make it work with current times - which mostly means making things remote.

You are being bcc'd on this email because I thought you might care too, and feel free to suggest other who might be.

**Here's the plan.**

I'm going to run a study group and skill share that meets once a week for 6 weeks. Each week will have a theme, something like "interviewing", "career development", "self care", that kind of thing.

We'll meet up once a week, remotely. Probably Sundays and I'll probably set up a Jitsi server. We'll start the weekend of October 25th and finish on November 29th, in time for the holidays. I'll create a Google group/mailing list for logistics and continuing discussion, and decommission it at the end.

**You should come if ...**

* You're at a place in your life and work where you need to level up at leadership and communications skills, and you're ready to put in the work
* You have stories to share, and thorny questions of your own to solve. You can make it at least 4 of the 6 weeks.
* You are willing and able to **keep a fucking secret**. It's a small town(*) and this must be a safe space for sharing.

So email me if you're interested or would like to nominate someone. I'll hand-pick a group of ~8 people to round out a balanced group(**) and pull it together over the next week or two. Please don't send me your problem children for re-education, that's not what this is.

As this is remote, you should also have a decent internet connection, be _fluent in English_ and you are willing to _turn on your video_. To do this thing remotely, we need all the communication bandwidth we can get.

**That's it.**

Aside from Charity's notes, I don't have a detailed battle plan (yet), but some ideas. I will prepare to facilitate the first meeting, and we'll take it from there. :) There may be some small reading assignments, visiting lecturers/experts, etc.

If it's a good experience, I'm happy to share what worked with others so they can run their own discussion groups. I think that time boxing it is key to creating intimacy, urgency and focus, but who knows?

Best,

Daniel

(*) Technically this isn't tied to any town, but the tech world can be a village.

(**) I'm looking for a diversity of roles (manager, IC, tech lead) and seniority (mid to experienced). I'm also aiming for at least 2/3 to be women/queers/BPoC. As per the original recommendation, I will pick only _one_ person per team/company.
